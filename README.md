# Automatic Railway gate control system

Computer Peripherals and Interfacing project..

Problem statement:
Our project aims to make railway crossings safer by creating an automatic gate control system. This system will help trains pass safely while stopping vehicles and pedestrians from entering the tracks when a train is approaching.

Purpose of the project:
1) Improve safety at railway crossings by preventing collisions and accidents between trains and road vehicles.
2) Develop an automated system to control railway gates, reducing the need for manual intervention.
3) Minimize unauthorized access to railway tracks, decreasing the risk of accidents and casualties.
4) Implement mechanisms for emergency personnel to control gates in critical situations.
5) Create a system that can be substitiute of railway gateman.
6) Allow trains to pass through crossings efficiently while minimizing disruptions to road traffic.

Features :
1) Rail detection through sensor
2) Sensor senses train from a certain distance
3) Rail gate open/close through servo motor

Tools and devices:
1)Arduino UNO
2)Ultra sonic sensor (HC-SR04)
3)Servo motor
4)Jumper wires 
5)USB connector
6) 3 mm PVC foam board.
